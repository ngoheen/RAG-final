### Scripts used:

#### These scripts came with the template
* jquery-2.1.1.min.js
* bootstrap.min.js
* jquery.plugins.js - this is all the plugins they used, in one script
* custom.js

Lots can be removed from the last two scripts, above.

#### These scripts all came with lightgallery which is used for popups

* lightgallery.js
* lg-fullscreen.js
* lg-video.js
* lg-zoom.js
* lg-hash.js
<br><br>
* lg.min.js is a __minified version__ of the above scripts
<br><br>
* lg-share-3.js - is for sharing social media on the lightgallery popups and needs work.

#### This js is just to make the video play onclick and is way more than needed
All I want is to be able to click **once** on the video that pops up and have it play. Right now, without the following js, I have to click on the video and then on the controls that pop in.
* http://vjs.zencdn.net/5.16.0/video.js
``` 
<script>
    $('.lg-video').on('click', function() {
        $(this).find('video').play();
    });
</script>
```

#### This script runs all the carousels
* owl.carousel.min.js


#### This script calls lightgallery and owlcarousel where needed
* lightbox-script.js


### Css used:

* bootstrap.css
* style.css
* lightgallery.css


### Image folders:
* *images folder* needs to be uploaded and contains images used throughout the site.
* *pics folder* contains dummies for the flat html pages.
* *photos folder* contains dummies for the flat gallery pages.
